## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This was a simple and informative project. I actually finished the css section
of Anjela yu's web dev course, so this was a really good way to test my knowledge.
Something I learnt was how to center elements using the flex, justify-content, and
align-items. I initially used margin to center it, lol.

```html
<center>
  part of how i centered my code earlier. (i'm curious. Is it good practice?)
</center>
```

```css
the-new-thing-i-learnt {
  align-items: center;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to more projects so I can continue to improve

### Useful resources

Just google
